# Solution for Graph Bipartiteness and Magnificent Sets

This repository contains a C++ solution to the problem of determining if a graph is bipartite and calculating the maximum number of levels (or "magnificent sets") in a given graph based on certain conditions.

## Problem Overview

Given a graph represented by `n` nodes and a list of edges, the goal is to:

1. **Check if the graph is bipartite**: This means that the graph can be colored using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.
2. **Calculate the maximum number of levels (or "magnificent sets")**: For each connected component of the graph, determine the maximum depth of traversal (or "level") using BFS. Sum these values to get the result.

The problem consists of:
- **Bipartite check**: A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be divided into two groups where each group is connected to the other, but no internal connections exist within a group.
- **BFS for levels**: The BFS function calculates the number of levels (depth) from each connected component, and the DFS function calculates the maximum depth across all components.

## Key Features

- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list for efficient traversal.
- **Bipartite Check**: We use a DFS approach to check if the graph can be divided into two disjoint sets (bipartite).
- **BFS Traversal**: BFS is used to determine the maximum level or depth of traversal for each component.
- **DFS for Maximum Levels**: DFS ensures we calculate the maximum depth for each connected component in the graph.

## C++ Code Overview

### Functions

- **isBipartite**: Checks if the graph is bipartite starting from a given node. Uses DFS and colors nodes alternatively to check for conflicts.
  
- **bfs**: Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from a given node and calculates the maximum level of nodes in the connected component.
  
- **getMaxFromEachComp**: Calculates the maximum level in each connected component using DFS, combining the results from BFS.

- **magnificentSets**: The main function that checks if the graph is bipartite, calculates the maximum levels for each component, and sums them up.

## Code Walkthrough

### Example Input:
Given a graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges:

```cpp
int n = 5;
vector<vector<int>> edges = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}};

1 -- 2
|
3 -- 4 -- 5

Output: 3
